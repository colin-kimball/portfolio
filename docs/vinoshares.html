            <p>VinoShares is a startup that I have been working on outside of my job at Erie Insurance.
                The idea of VinoShares is to make expensive and hard to obtain wines available by the glass instead of
                the bottle. Often times expensive bottles are only available for purchase by the bottle. Our solution
                makes all bottles available by the glass, by offering shares (5oz. pours) of the wine. This is made
                possible when a bottle is successfully crowdsourced by the VinoShares community (meaning that 5
                shares must be bought). Because of our crowdsourcing method, a bottle can be opened and consumed in one
                night to prevent deterioration of the product. VinoShares partners with local restaurant hosts to hold
                events where consumers can come and enjoy their wine shares.</p>
            <p><b>Project Goal:</b> To build a progressive web app for users to view and purchase shares to be consumed
                at events in their area. Basically, we had to build this platform from the ground up. </p>

            <p>Users can browse events by clicking a link in the navbar or clicking 'Get started' button on the home
                page. The
                results display on the page below. In order to narrow down the results, I added a search bar, filters,
                and sort feature.</p>

                of how many shares (glasses of wine) they want. As the user scrolls the tile on the right sticks to the
                top so the user can update their share quantity and reserve shares from any point on the page. </p>

                'Save credit card' checkbox. </p>

                A review of their purchase along with a confirmation number are shown. Additionally, the user is
                prompted to share the event with their peers in an attempt to help successfully crowdsource the event.
