            <p>The Pattern Library is a project that we started to build a set of reusable UI components that could
                be consumed by applications across the company to increase consistency and speed to market. The library
                consists of a CSS stylesheet and JavaScript resource to reference in applications. </p>
            <p><b>Project Goal:</b> To create a single source of reusable code, allowing for developers to deliver
                consistent applications faster.</p>
            <p><b>Team:</b> A small group of User Experience designers and various engineers contributing to the library
                over the course of the project.

            <h1>Wiki documentation home page</h1>
            <p>Shown below is a redesign of the internal documentation wiki for our Pattern Library. The
                Pattern Library is a set of reusable UI components built to ensure consistency across applications. The
                Wiki, shown below, is a very important part of explaining why using the library is useful, and more
                importantly, how teams can use it.</p>
            <p>The documentation wasn't always well organized though. Many teams didn't understand how to use the
                library, or even why it would benefit them. A redesign and new approach changed how the Pattern Library
                was viewed. Now, 10 applications use the library across the enterprise.</p>

                them. Expanding the 'View source' accordion section below each example allows users to view and copy the

            <p>As a User Experience team, we noticed inconsistency within our own team’s
                designs as well as in the execution by different development teams across enterprise
                portfolios and product lines.

                <p>Our goal was to create a single code source where developers could grab ‘components’
                    and easily insert them into their application. We decided to provide a CSS stylesheet
                    and JavaScript resource to reference in applications across the company. Then all developers need to
                    do is copy and paste the HTML into the application.</p>

                    <li>Define standards and components
                        <p>Our User Experience team began defining what we considered our standards and
                            guidelines that all application designs should follow. These included formatting of data
                            elements (i.e. Addresses, Dates, Email, etc.), color, and typography, among
                            other things.</p>
                        <p>We also began to identify reusable components (UI patterns that were used on
                            multiple applications) such as Textboxes, Search Components, Modal Windows,
                            Dropdowns, etc. Then our design team began to develop specifications for how
                            these components should look and function.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Build the repository
                        <p>We collaborated with a small group of developers to create the base repository
                            for housing the components. We decided to customize the popular HTML, CSS,
                            and JavaScript framework, Bootstrap (developed by Twitter). We thought
                            this would help to expedite the process. To avoid excess bloat, we took bits
                            and pieces of the Bootstrap library and customized them on a 1 by 1 basis.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Build the components
                        <p>A small group of developers began to build components according to specifications
                            developed by our User Experience design team.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Build the documentation layer (Wiki)
                        <p>In order to be successful, every development library, framework, or style guide
                            needs a great documentation site. We built a documentation ‘wiki’ where we
                            displayed functioning components and explained how to use them.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Communicate the project
                        <p>As this was not an official project, but a self-started collaborative project
                            between the User Experience team and a small group of engineers, there was not a
                            ton of visibility. We had created a great resource to improve consistency and speed
                            up development time, but no one knew it existed.</p>
                        <p>So, we presented our solution to an audience of IT and business stakeholders and
                            also did some hands-on training with engineers.</p>

                        <p>The Erie Insurance Web Asset Library was not adopted by many teams in the first
                            year of its existence. Unfortunately, the value was not fully understood by
                            teams.

                    <li>How do we use it?
                        <p>The documentation layer was a huge problem. Clear explanations were not offered
                            and the wiki site needed to be redesigned.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>What is a 'Web Asset'?
                        <p>The name of the library, Web Assets, was ambiguous at best. It was unclear what
                            the Web Asset Library was and what consumers would be getting by referencing it.

                        <p>Our User Experience team began defining what we considered our standards and
                            before building the initial Library, some research was done on how other
                            companies were building UI Component Libraries, but evidently not enough.
                            We started over and looked at some of the Pattern Libraries and Style Guides
                            that the top companies were developing. Some of the main influencers of our
                            refresh were: Salesforce Lightning Design System, Google Material UI, and IBM Carbon Design
                            System.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Redesign & wiki documentation development
                        <p>Using some industry leading style guides and pattern libraries for inspiration,
                            we developed conceptual designs of what our ‘documentation wiki’ should look like. We nailed
                            down the detailed design and rebuilt the wiki complete with a 'Getting started' page, the
                            opportunity to submit feedback, and release notes.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Project management
                        <p>Another opportunity we had for improvement was around project management and
                            organization. We operated mainly in an Aglie-ish methodology, but we weren’t
                            delivering nearly as often as we wanted to. Some of this was do to the fact that
                            this was sort of a rogue operation, but also because we did not have an
                            established project management plan. We created a Trello board to manage
                            cards and gain visibility around work. This helped us commit to deadlines,
                            create a backlog, and chunk our work into sprints and specific development cards.

                    value of referencing the library in their applciations. Regular new version releases (using semantic
                    versioning) and updates to the library coupled with release notes allowed for much more visibility
                    into the development. Currently, 10 applications use the library across the enterprise and
                    suggestions for improvement are regularly submitted.
