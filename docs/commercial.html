            <p>This project is currently the largest IT initiative at my company. The goal is to build an
                industry leading quoting and application system for our independent agent force. My role is Lead User
                Experience Designer. We were tasked with adding a new commercial product that combines 7 products
                into one, that agents can sell as a business package policy. Additionally we are enabling
                agents with the ability to digitally service their policies. This includes making policy changes,
                billing changes,
                and accessing claims information.</p>
            <p><b>Project Goal:</b> Enhance current quote and application system design and workflow. Add new package
                product that combines 7 products into one, while adding
                full policy servicing capabilities. </p>

                would progressively fill out the screen. A common 'Customer Account' would consist of 4 products which
                would evenly fill the viewport.</p>

            <h1>Underwriting referral workflow</h1>
            <p>One of the most complex workflows we needed to address was letting our Agents know if their quote or
                application needed to be referred to an Underwriter. The old process for referrals was to display a
                generic message to our Agents on every page of the application letting them know that some referrals
                existed, but not telling them what the referrals were for.
            </p>
            <img class="image-dropshadow" src="images/generic_uw_message.jpg"
                alt="Commercial Insurance Application - Generic Underwriting Message">
            <p>Through user-research conducted with our Agents, we found that this was a huge pain point for them, and
                something that other insurance companies were handling much better. Agents wanted clarity on what was
                causing their application to be referred to an Underwriter. The process caused both confusion and a
                delay in processing applications due to the need for action to be taken by an Underwriter.</p>

            <h1>Underwriting referrals at Quote</h1>
            <p>When the user navigates to the Coverages page for the first time, they are able to see their quote
                premium. If any underwriting referrals have been triggered up to this point, we display them here to let
                Agents know that the referrals may affect risk acceptability and pricing. This allows the Agent to be
                aware
                of potential concerns with the risk and creates transparency with the Customer about the premium amount.

            <p>When the user clicks 'Continue to see premium' they will land on the Coverages page and see their quote
                premium. At this point, the user can now access Underwriting referrals from the header (which we
                indicate to them using a helpful popover). Providing referrals via this link in the header allowed us to
                mitigate performance concerns by only calling the referrals service when the user clicks this link.</p>

            <p>We show refferals at the end of the workflow when the Agent completes the application and is ready to
                submit the policy. This is the most critical point in the workflow. Additional referrals could've been
                triggered during the application process, so those will be displayed to Agents, along with an area to
                enter the Underwriter that they spoke with and when. This last step puts the onus on the Agent to be
                sure he/she is writing good business. This data is stored and can be referenced by home office employees
                if a policy is written outside of our risk appetite.</p>
